GraalVM is a Java Development Kit (JDK) written in Java.
The open-source distribution of GraalVM is based on OpenJDK, and the enterprise distribution is based on Oracle JDK.
As well as just-in-time (JIT) compilation, GraalVM can compile a Java application ahead of time.
This allows for faster initialization, greater runtime performance, and decreased resource consumption, but the resulting executable can only run on the platform it was compiled for.

It provides additional programming languages and execution modes.
The first production-ready release, GraalVM 19.0, was distributed in May 2019.
The most recent release is GraalVM for JDK 23, made available in September 2024.
